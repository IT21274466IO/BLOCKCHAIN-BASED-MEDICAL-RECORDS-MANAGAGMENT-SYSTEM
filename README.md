# Introduction
Managing medical records securely and efficiently is a critical challenge for healthcare institutions. Current systems often face issues such as data breaches, inefficiencies in accessing records, and lack of interoperability, which hinder effective patient care. To address these challenges, our research focuses on developing a Blockchain-Based Medical Records Management System. Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and tamper-proof framework, ensuring secure storage and controlled sharing of medical data. This research aims to enhance the reliability of medical record systems while laying the foundation for scalable, secure, and future-ready healthcare solutions.

# Overview 
Our research focuses on developing a Blockchain-Based Medical Records Management System for Healthcare Institutions to enhance data security, privacy, and accessibility. The system integrates blockchain technology to securely store various types of medical records, including medical images , patient-doctor conversation reports,  and medical report data. Each team member contributes a distinct component and integrating  Machine learning models are utilized for image processing and predictive analysis, creating a comprehensive healthcare ecosystem. Each component addresses specific aspects of data storage and analysis, ensuring a robust and patient-centric solution. This approach enhances the security and accessibility of critical medical information. The project envisions a future where healthcare data is seamlessly managed with blockchain technology.
